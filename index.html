        <div class="writing">
            <p><b>[NOTE ON THE TITLE] </b>“Geocitis” is the name of a tumblr blog I ran during my undergraduate thesis year. I used it to collect artists, artworks, readings, phenomena, and memes related to the subject of art & technology—or more specifically, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Aesthetic" class="bib" target="_blank">New Aesthetic</a> (sidenote: the subhead for the blog was “The New Assthetic”), a term coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bridle" class="bib" target="_blank">James Bridle</a> to refer to the increasing appearance of the visual language of digital technology and the Internet in the physical world, and the blending of virtual and physical. The New Aesthetic was cutting edge in 2012, for the same reasons it feels dated today, where the “newness” of digital technology’s encroachment onto the physical world has given way to ubiquity.</p>

            <p>So why revive the title of a defunct blog dedicated to an obsolete movement? To explain, I turn to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities" class=
                "bib" target="_blank">Geocities (1994–2019)</a>, the dead web hosting service from which the name “Geocitis” was derived. With the invention of the web browser by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" class="bib" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee</a> in 1990, the general public could finally access the Internet, heretofore the purview of the military or large commercial enterprises. However, the absolute novelty of a digital existence made the concept difficult for many to grasp—that is, until Geocities provided a spatial metaphor for the scale and power of the Web.</p>

            <p>Geocities operated around the premise of 29 “neighborhoods” categorized by interests, i.e. “HotSprings” for health and fitness, or “Area51” for sci-fi and fantasy. In order to establish a web presence, users (known as “homesteaders”) were tasked with finding an empty lot in one of these “locales.” As the userbase ballooned, these neighborhoods spread outwards into thematic suburbs, <a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/01/geocities-archive-netscape-browser-first-web-suburbs-aol/580285/" class="bib" target="_blank">reflecting the American sprawl inhabited by many of the Internet’s early adopters in the physical plane</a>. The largest community amidst this growth was known as “Heartland,” which—due to its declared function as the “Main Street [of] cyberspace ”—encouraged its digital inhabitants to make a general, rather than subcultural, homepage.</p>

            <p>However, the supposed neutrality of Heartland was anything but. With a stated emphasis on “parenting, pets, and hometown values,” Heartland reflected the interests of a specific demographic, the same demographic that had the disposable income to become early adopters of the net: wealthy, white, and American. Coupled with the Manifest Destiny-esque language of homesteading, which turned the Internet into unoccupied territory for claiming, Geocities (and the early Web as a whole) mirrored the settler-colonialist trajectories of Western history.</p>

            <p>To return to the obsoleting of the New Aesthetic, the pervasiveness of digital technology in contemporary existence discourages critical suspicion even as it shares the skewed lineage of Geocities. At the time of writing, COVID-19 has exacerbated the condition of digital entrenchment. Due to the monopolization of Internet traffic by a handful of tech giants, we interface with the Web as a breeding ground for non-neutral social positioning.</p>

            <p>The “-itis” in “Geocitis” is the suffix of infection. Its inclusion here is an acknowledgement of current circumstances as well as a call to action for design-as-virus, elaborated below. The title of a defunct blog dedicated to an obsolete movement serves here as a sigil, imbued with the desire for this work, too, to be obsoleted at its fulfillment.</p>

                Nations story about a skate who, by nature of its morphology, plays an important role in capturing the
                South Wind. A skate, for those unfamiliar, is a flat fish that appears extremely wide when viewed from
                above and extremely thin when viewed from the side. In this story, the skate leverages its shape to
                escape its adversaries’ arrows simply by turning sideways. <a

            <blockquote>If we look closely, we see that the real world begins, in the modern age, with the decision to
                <a class="concept power">transform the world,</a> and to do so by means of science, analytical
                knowledge, and the <a class="concept power">implementation of
                    technology</a>—that is to say, it begins in Hannah Arendt’s words, with the invention of an
                Archimedian
                point outside the world (on the basis of the invention of the telescope by Galileo and the discovery of
                modern <a class="keyterm math">mathematical</a> calculation) by which the natural world is
                definitively <a class="keyterm anthropological-machine border">alienated.</a> This is the
                moment when human beings, while setting about analyzing and transforming the world, take their leave of
                it, while at the same time <a class="concept power">lending it force of reality</a>. …<a class="concept negation">to ‘analyze’ means literally
                    ‘to dissolve.’</a></blockquote>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard" target="_blank" class="bib">Baudrillard</a>
                argues that by understanding the world through our ability to transform it, we have begun its
                process of disappearance. Through defining a reality utilizing the parameters of the virtual and the
                scientific, we call a world into being in which we, as “natural beings” have disappeared. In observing
                the world, we haunt it.</p>

            <p class="subhead"><b>3.</b> <a class="keyterm anthropological-machine">Animal</a></p>

            <p>In <a href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=5305" class="bib" target="_blank">The Open: Man and
                    Animal</a>, philosopher <a id="agamben" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Agamben" class="bib"
                    target="blank">Giorgio Agamben</a> presents an analytical distance from the
                world not as the disappearance of the <a class="keyterm anthropological-machine" id="human1">human</a> but rather as its defining feature. He coins the term <a
                    class="concept anthropological-machine">“anthropological machine”</a> to describe the separation of man and animal as a
                working construct used to ascribe worth to certain humans (and nonhuman animals) to the exclusion of
                others. Man, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt" class="bib"
                    target="_blank">Hannah Arendt’s</a> Archimedian point, is able to comport themself towards themself
                and
                view something as something, which makes them “open” to their world. The Animal is only captivated,
                subject to <a class="concept adversarial interaction anthropological-machine">experience without analysis,</a> thus making them “poor” in the world. What then of the skate,
                surrounded by its man-animal comrades, a ghost in the anthropological machine? </p>

            <p>Let’s turn to methodologies. The diagram above illustrates the reason for all the writing, which is to
                create a conceptual loop. The loop is a <a class="keyterm border">border</a>; it <a class="keyterm border">delineates</a> a territory of inquiry. <a class="keyterm myth">Excavating</a> this
                area yields the shared invariant across different components (the structure). Questioning how they are
                shared reveals their valences (the details).
            </p>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_L%C3%A9vi-Strauss" target="_blank"
                    class="bib">Lévi-Strauss</a>, also in <a 
                    href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/100664/myth-and-meaning-by-claude-levi-strauss/"
                    class="bib" target="_blank">Myth and Meaning</a>, examines how myth and history blur together in
                oral
                traditions, allowing different kinship <a class="keyterm system">networks</a> to describe the same story in an array of ways. The
                event in question might be <a class="keyterm myth">historical</a> (as in, actually happened), but the details are different
                (therefore, <a class="keyterm myth">mythic</a>). The details comprise an explanatory <a class="keyterm virus">cell</a>. The basic structure
                of the cell is the same across stories, making it recognizable as belonging to the same event type,
                despite its varying content. To use design terminology, myth and history follow the principle of
                “<a class="concept system">constant and variable.</a>” A <a class="keyterm system">system</a> is a narrative.</p>

            <p>The subtitle for <a
                    href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/100664/myth-and-meaning-by-claude-levi-strauss/"
                    class="bib" target="_blank">Myth and Meaning</a> is “Cracking the <a class="keyterm lexicon">Code</a> of
                Culture.” The first
                process is one of <i>de-</i>coding.</p>
            <div class="diagram"><img id="package" src="images/FP_package.png" alt="CAPITALISM WILL NOT AND WAS NEVER GOING TO SAVE US"></div>

            <p>The second process is one of <i>en-</i><a class="keyterm hidden">coding</a>. Each explanatory <a class="keyterm virus" >cell</a> is a complete circuit, a <a class="keyterm myth">mini-myth</a>
                capable of standing on its own. The process of decoding uncovers the underlying structure dictating the
                cells’ <a class="keyterm interaction">interactions</a>; the process of encoding ascribes meaning to this internal logic. </p>

            <p>“Meaning” packages the internal logic into a qualitative unit that can then <a class="keyterm interaction">interact</a> with semantics outside itself. A narrative is a system.
            </p>

            <div class="diagram"><img id="triangle" src="images/FP_Triangle.png" alt="CAPITALISM WILL NOT AND WAS NEVER GOING TO SAVE US"></div>

            <p>The third process is one of simultaneous <a class="keyterm lexicon hidden">encoding</a> and <a class="keyterm lexicon ">decoding</a>. As befitting a methodology beginning with
                a <a class="keyterm border">border</a> and a territory, I turn to the <a class="keyterm nonlinear">triangulation</a> technique used in surveying. Triangulation
                determines the location of a new point by measuring the angles between it and two known points on a
                fixed baseline. If meaning units or explanatory cells are known (to me) points, then the angles are
                <a class="keyterm lexicon">lexicons</a> brought in by an audience to act as partial ciphers. These parameters together locate the
                “work”—a <a class="concept lexicon interaction">collaborative semantic map</a> codifying a shared experience.</p>

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <div class="diagram"><img class="infection" src="images/FP_MicroMacro.png" alt="CAPITALISM WILL NOT AND WAS NEVER GOING TO SAVE US"></div>
            <p>The work exists only through <a class="keyterm nonlinear">inference</a> and intersection; here is the building of <a class="keyterm negation">Outopos</a>, the No Place. I
                deliberately use “Outopos,” the Greek root of “utopia,” to avoid the saccharine positivity of the
                latter. However, I can’t say I’m not drawn to the utopian potentiality of an <a class="keyterm open-closed">open system</a> defined by
                <a class="concept interaction virus">presentation, invitation, and exchange</a>.</p>

            <p><a class="keyterm interaction">Interaction</a> is the test of a <a class="keyterm system">system</a>. When I work on a project, I often ask myself whether I am making an
                <a class="concept open-closed">open or a closed system</a>, with an open system defined as one that can be changed by user input. Both have
                their uses, and both have their challenges, as any world-building exercise should. I ask to better
                situate myself as a creator, <a class="keyterm anthropological-machine">user</a>, hacker, and/or <a class="keyterm computer adversarial negation">hack</a>, which in turn informs my approach to existing
                systems as consumer, citizen, victim, or <a class="keyterm adversarial">antagonist</a>.</p>

            <p>I ask to understand <a class="concept system hidden power">what systems have to say</a> and <a class="concept lexicon math">how they say it</a>, to seed them with
                connective <a class="keyterm lexicon nonlinear">language</a> like <a class="keyterm binary">binary</a> for a skate’s operation. How can the <a class="keyterm negation">negated</a> space of Outopos offer
                multiple points of access? Where can a <a class="keyterm hidden adversarial">Trojan Horse</a> be opened and still remain a gift? I resist <a class="keyterm border">borders</a>,
                <a class="keyterm border">delineation</a>, and <a class="keyterm anthropological-machine">classification</a>, hence why I engage them. Perhaps the moving target of a constantly
                redefined No Place can facilitate the <a class="concept negation nonlinear">non-binary articulation</a> of a non-binary practice. What does
                designing from here look like?</p>

            <p>How does a diary differ from a dossier? Both contain similarly sensitive information on a person, but from opposite points of agency.

The diary is a space of emotional <a class="keyterm vulnerable">vulnerability</a>. However, diary-as-data makes us vulnerable in far less contained ways.

            <p>In <a class="keyterm computer">computer</a> security, a vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a <a class="keyterm adversarial virus">threat actor</a>, such as an attacker, to perform unauthorized actions within a computer system. To exploit a vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to a system <a class="keyterm vulnerable virus">weakness</a>. At this point, "Big Data" is a household term, and how Big Data knows us—the <a class="keyterm interaction anthropological-machine">users</a> and consumers—is also common knowledge. Big Data knows us to sell us stuff (mostly). <a class="keyterm desire vulnerable">Desire</a> is our system vulnerability.</p>

            <p><i>Viral/Vulnerable</i> is a website featuring a modified version of ELIZA, an early chatbot made in the 1960s that simulates the strategies of a Rogerian psychotherapist. ELIZA's creator, Joseph Weizenbaum created the program to show the superficiality of communication between <a class="keyterm anthropological-machine">man</a> and <a class="keyterm anthropological-machine computer">machine</a>, as ELIZA could only use pattern-matching and substitution along strict rules—not true understanding—to respond to user input. However, Weizenbaum was surprised by the number of individuals who <a class="concept anthropological-machine">attributed human-like feelings to her</a> (see my own use of a human pronoun here).</p>

            <p><i>Viral/Vulnerable</i>’s chatbot is named Kit Son Lee and asks leading questions to encourage users to engage in the emotional openness of therapy. Any time a user enters a “<a class="keyterm desire open-closed lexicon interaction">desire</a> word”—i.e. “want,” “need,” “wish,” or “aspire,” discerned through <a  class="concept vulnerable virus hidden">keylogging</a> (a technique often used in <a class="keyterm virus vulnerable computer hidden adversarial">malware</a> to steal passwords or credit card information, also used by sites such as <a href="http://facebook.com" class="bib" target="_blank">Facebook</a> to save status updates one may have deemed too sensitive to actually post)—an image appears in the window. These images are <a href="http://google.com" class="bib" target="_blank">Google</a> Image search results for words pulled from my own personal dossier: the full list of advertisement key terms associated with my <a href="http://facebook.com" class="bib" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com" class="bib" target="_blank">Instagram</a> profiles. Clicking on an image leads to an automated <a href="http://amazon.com" class="bib" target="_blank">Amazon</a> search for the associated term, and because the user has now “searched” for that term, <a class="concept vulnerable virus adversarial system">my ad becomes their ad</a>. <a class="keyterm desire">Desire</a> is the <a class="keyterm virus">viral</a> channel; the user’s emotional <a class="keyterm vulnerable adversarial">vulnerability</a> has become the avenue for a non-consensual change in personal data.</p>

However, what the instructions fail to mention is that the <a class="keyterm system interaction">mechanism</a> in play is based on an <a class="concept adversarial">old parlor trick</a>, most recently popularized by the now-defunct website <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lady-esmereldas-crystal-ball/" class="bib" target="_blank">Lady Esmerelda’s Crystal Ball</a>, which was so convincing that <i>Snopes</i> had to debunk rumors of “<a class="concept computer power">computer possession</a>” or other such system <a class="keyterm vulnerable adversarial virus">vulnerabilities</a> amongst unsettled users.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lady-esmereldas-crystal-ball/" class="bib" target="_blank">Lady Esmerelda’s Crystal Ball</a> and <i>Chaos Agent</i> both operate using “<a class="keyterm power hidden">forcing</a>,” a technique in (stage) magic wherein a participant is seemingly given a wide array of choices and is therefore astounded when their choice is correctly identified. In actuality, there is only one possible choice, dictated by the equation (10X + Y) – (X + Y) = 9X. All multiples of 9 yield the same result, and only multiples of 9 can be chosen. Behind <a class="keyterm power">magic</a> lies <a class="keyterm math power">numbers</a>.</p>

            <p>The phrase “go down the rabbit hole” first appeared in Lewis Carroll’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland" class="bib" target="_blank">Alice in Wonderland</a> but did not enter into widespread use until the <a class="keyterm system open-closed">Internet</a> provided a seemingly endless void of distraction to fall into. <i>Warren</i> draws from these <a class="concept nonlinear interaction">nonlinear navigational practices</a>, as exemplified in <a href="http://wikipedia.org" class="bib" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and in <a href="http://apple.com" class="bib" target="_blank">Apple</a>’s early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard" class="bib" target="_blank">HyperCard</a> program, to create its own interconnected database of burrows, dens, and false ends.</p>

            <p>The content of the site maps Aristotle’s ten categories to the ten techniques of stage <a class="keyterm power system">magic</a> and demonstrates each with an illustration of a magician’s rabbit. Clicking into different parts of the rabbit leads the viewer into elaborations on different magical topics, ranging from props to Sacred Geometry, with each page containing a definition or elaboration of the term. These writings are themselves populated with <a class="concept system">hyperlinks</a>, and as the reader clicks through, the topics spiral deeper and outwards to encompass subjects as diverse as Orientalism, nootropics, <a class="keyterm border computer system">machine learning</a>, and object-oriented ontology.</p>

            <p>Though the path permutations created by following different hyperlinks suggest an infinite scope, the <a class="keyterm system">system</a> is in fact <a class="concept open-closed">closed</a>, designed to <a class="concept open-closed nonlinear">loop</a> back into surface-level magical topics, and sometimes just acting as an unexpected exit to the homepage. This technique once again uses “<a class="keyterm power interaction">forcing</a>,” as seen in <i>Chaos Agent</i>, to craft a contained series of <a class="keyterm system nonlinear">interconnections</a> between disparate fields. By virtue of the consecutive nature of clicking-through, an intentional narrative arises, dictated by the choices I’ve made to <a class="concept nonlinear lexicon border">bridge disparate topics</a> to each other, their relationship further reinforced by the written “definitions” on each page.</p>

            <p><i>Machine in the <a class="keyterm anthropological-machine">Ghost</a></i> is a library-building <a class="keyterm tool">tool</a> disguised as a performative-<a class="keyterm interaction utility">interactive</a> installation. Upon priming the audience with a claim to a <a class="keyterm power">magical</a> means of <a class="concept power desire">manifesting will</a>, I act as a medium to guide them through a tarot-esque process of summoning voices of <a class="keyterm power">futurity</a> into conversation. An “offering” of a personal future-oriented reading reference is required to proceed to the next step, wherein one can input their own vision of futurity into the <a  class="keyterm computer">computer</a>. The <a class="concept anthropological-machine power">screen comes alive</a> and outputs text pulled from previously-included voices, at the end of which a “contract” is initiated. Within a salt pentagram behind the computer, a hologram of a sigil appears, customized based on the input vision + generated text as a unique graphic container for that specific version of the future. This sigil is then to be memorized and implanted into the subconscious in order to guide one’s actions towards the building of that future.</p>

            <p>I originally started <i>Machine in the Ghost</i> to make a point about how all <a class="keyterm power myth">magic</a> is a combination of <a class="keyterm math">math</a> and <a class="keyterm anthropological-machine utility">engineering</a>, how unnatural phenomena often have logical explanations. The code of the project still reflects this ethos: for all its spectral aesthetics, the sigils are vectors generated using pseudorandom numbers, which are derived by mapping the letters of the <a class="keyterm anthropological-machine">user</a>’s input to certain values. The ghostly auto-generation of text following the user’s input is simply a Markov chain, wherein the probability of one word following another is calculated by analyzing frequency of appearance within a corpus of text (the library).</p>

            <p>I began to lose conviction in this original intention, however, when I realized that—regardless of the back end of its mechanisms—the project was first and foremost a <a class="keyterm utility">tool</a> to <a class="concept power lexicon">expand an audience’s capacity</a> to <a class="keyterm power">imagine</a> <a class="keyterm power myth">futures</a> of all kinds. This is the point at which I added the “offering” component. The original library included in the project was curated by myself, and though I tried to be expansive in the types of futures included, whether in genre, political positions, or subject matter, it was inherently limited by my own knowledge. <a class="concept open-closed system">Opening the system</a> to allow additions to the library <a  class="concept vulnerable">relinquished control</a> over the visions of futurity that could be created, thus also opening the possibilities I myself could imagine. In that sense, the critical stance of <i>Machine in the Ghost</i> lay not in the debunking of magic wholesale but in expanding 1) the base capacity for magical thinking, and 2) the potential for a user to <a class="concept power myth desire">fulfill one of the offered prophecies</a>.</p>

            <p><i>National Treasure</i> features a collection of amorphous shapes rendered in VR using Oculus Medium and skinned with textures derived from an early <a class="keyterm border computer anthropological-machine">machine learning</a> dataset. Portions of the shapes are pixelated to flatten them into the vernacular of the digital <a class="keyterm myth">artifact</a>. Interspersed between the shapes are various QR codes leading to the aforementioned dataset, various Nicolas Cage <a class="keyterm virus system">memes</a>, and a prototype website that "<a  class="keyterm lexicon hidden">decodes</a>" the shapes into various parts of the script for <i>National Treasure</i> (2004).</p>

            <p>This poster began with a <a class="keyterm utility">tool</a> study of a Structure Sensor, a 3D scanner for use with iPads. Deconstructing the resulting scans yielded texture maps reminiscent of <a class="keyterm myth">archaeological</a> object <a class="keyterm border lexicon binary">taxonomies</a>, while experiments with scanning moving images (such as a video) revealed captured frames that were not visible in the final render. Both the textured maps and the moving scan experiments suggested the existence of <a class="keyterm hidden">hidden</a> data in the Structure Sensor’s output. <i>National Treasure</i> plays on this idea of hidden data by utilizing <a class="keyterm hidden">steganography</a>—the process of concealing a file within another file (oftentimes a jpeg or video)—and <a class="keyterm hidden">Easter Eggs</a>—messages, images, or features hidden in a video game, film, or other (usually electronic) medium. The VR shapes are rendered in the nebulous aesthetics of <a class="keyterm border computer anthropological-machine">Machine Learning</a> generated imagery, another form in which source data is made <a class="keyterm hidden open-closed">opaque.</a></p>

            <p>If archaeology is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture, <a class="keyterm system">Internet</a> archaeology faces the challenge of recording the <a  class="concept anthropological-machine virus">increasingly immaterial ways in which contemporary culture is created</a>. The movie <i>National Treasure</i> is one such example, where the film, itself couched in archaeological and <a class="keyterm hidden lexicon">cryptographic</a> tropes, has found traction online in meme format. How can a poster, rendered digitally, <a class="concept virus">circulate in the substrate</a> of the recent Web to preserve and encourage archaeological curiosity? What <a class="keyterm lexicon">literacies</a> emerge when the average meme viewer knows to investigate underlying data in this way?</p>

            <p>Inspired by the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/elowan-a-plant-robot-hybrid/overview/" class="bib" target="_blank">Elowan project</a> at MIT Media Lab, <i>ScreenThumb</i> adapts the cutting-edge research into plant-<a class="keyterm interaction">interface</a> communication for a mass audience by proposing a speculative consumer app. The project takes the form of a pitch video as a parody of the storytelling tropes seen in many tech product introductions.</p>

            <p>ScreenThumb (the app) supposedly works by <a class="keyterm lexicon">translating</a> the electrical impulses of a plant into natural <a class="keyterm anthropological-machine">human</a> <a class="keyterm lexicon">language</a> to convey its needs to its caretakers. The copywriting imbues the plant with a personality similar to that of a petulant child, and in tandem with the bright colors and <a class="keyterm desire">need</a> alerts, the effect is altogether in the realm of a baby monitor. Suggesting this confluence taps into our species’ <a class="concept vulnerable">caretaking instinct</a>; by giving human <a class="keyterm lexicon">language</a> to a <a class="keyterm anthropological-machine border">non-human</a> entity, we are <a class="concept virus">implicated in liability</a> for it.</p>

            <p>The plant’s voice does not come from a vacuum. Translation requires two <a class="keyterm lexicon">lexicons</a>, and therefore, the plant can be said to communicate. The form of an app leverages <a class="keyterm utility">utility</a> as a means of introducing empathy for <a class="concept anthropological-machine">non-human</a> life so as to shift the bounds of our responsibility towards sustainable ends.</p>

            <p>A common contemporary complaint is that the <a class="keyterm system">Internet</a> has <a class="power">created the conditions</a> for extreme polarization of opinions due in parts to: 1) the <a class="concept virus">increasing speed</a> at which journalists and content creators must respond to breaking news in order to attract viewership; 2) the ease with which the everyday social media user <a class="concept virus">can publish and disseminate their opinions</a>, informed or otherwise; 3) a saturated mediascape <a class="concept adversarial nonlinear">discouraging long periods of engagement</a> with any one work, article, or idea. In response to the latter in particular, journalistic outlets, e-learning platforms, and advertisers are employing <a class="keyterm system">gamification</a> as a means of retaining attention. Rewarding a <a class="concept anthropological-machine">reader's/user's/customer's</a> engagement with a <a class="concept utility">product/service/work</a> incentivizes a larger contribution from a finite pool of time. Are the few more seconds extracted via these game tactics enough in and of themselves? What if <a class="keyterm power">monetization</a> of attention weren't the primary goal? What is the potential, in a landscape where reading a headline is the measure of reading an article, for games to encourage thought beyond the words on a webpage?</p>

            <p><i>Hot Take Game Lab</i> posits game systems and the <a class="keyterm computer">computational</a> decisions behind them as mediums for making <a class="keyterm lexicon">meaning</a>. A “hot take” is a piece of commentary, typically produced quickly in response to a recent event, whose primary purpose is to attract attention. The Lab’s current hypothesis: Engagement with <a class="concept system computer">computational systems</a> creates opportunity for critical thinking via <a class="keyterm interaction">immersion</a>, <a class="concept virus">implication, and repetition</a>. Chances for engagement are highest when <a class="keyterm power">market</a> saturation is low and novelty value is high, a.k.a. at Hot Take Speed. The Lab’s key inquiries are: 1) How can gamification be leveraged to not only retain attention but to encourage meaningful engagement with a topic? 2) How can an <a class="keyterm interaction">interactive</a> computational system provide frameworks and tools for thought that challenge the <a class="keyterm vulnerable open-closed interaction">passive</a> <a class="concept anthropological-machine">writer-reader relationship</a> of online journalism? 3) What effect does speed and topicality have on the narrative experience contained in gameplay?</p>

            <p>This project is ongoing.</p>

            <p class="subhead"><b>Game 1:</b> <i>Safe Space</i></p>
            <p><i>Safe Space</i> was created in October 2019 in response to the announcement of Frank Ocean’s PrEP+ party, which was billed as an “an ongoing <a class="concept anthropological-machine border">safe space</a> made to bring people together,...an homage to what could have been of the 1980s’ NYC club scene if [PrEP]... had been invented in that era.” The party immediately drew <a class="keyterm adversarial">criticism</a> for its <a class="keyterm negation border">exclusive</a> guest list, which appeared antithetical to the stated mission of <a class="keyterm open-closed">inclusivity</a>.</p>

            <p><i>Safe Space</i> is a loving drag of Brooklyn’s leftist nightlife scene and its perpetual struggle to create “safe” parties, the definition of which changes along <a class="concept border">individual identifying parameters</a>. The game is set against the backdrop of Mood Ring, a popular <a class="concept border anthropological-machine">QTPOC-centric</a> bar (my personal favorite), and is not meant to trash efforts at creating safer spaces.</p>

            <p class="subhead"><b>Game 2:</b> <i>De[ep] Forest</i></p>
            <p><i>De[ep] Forest</i> was created in October 2019 in response to the Trump administration’s proposal to allow logging in Alaska's Tongass National Forest. Based on the <a class="keyterm system">mechanics</a> of Pong, this mini-game presents a <a class="concept power">win condition</a> of logging all trees in the game field. If you lose based on this metric, Exxon Mobil will be the one to announce your failure. If you win based on this metric, a second mini-game appears: the win condition appears to be keeping your avatar from drowning; the player is quick to find, however, that there is no way to keep their head above water under the threat of rising sea levels.</p>

            <p>“who tf is jon sueda” is a text message I sent sometime around 4AM on April 18, 2020 to a group chat
                seething
                with reproach against the well-appointed home setups featured on @wfh_wfm. Jon Sueda is a “successful”
                graphic designer. He is also the creator of @wfh_wfm. I suppose I should’ve known him, and upon
                <a href="http://google.com" class="bib" target="_blank">Googling</a>, it
                turns out I did. He’s the maker behind <a href="http://allpossiblefutures.net/" class="bib"
                    target="_blank">All Possible Futures</a>, a project that has continually held a
                central spot in my reference library, a guidepost for the development of my design practice.
            </p>

            <p>@wfh_wfm is an <a href="http://instagram.com" class="bib" target="_blank">Instagram</a> account. Its name is an acronym for “Working From Home Works For Me.” The first
                post, featuring Sueda’s own setup at the dining table with his two sons, is captioned with the story of
                the
                project’s inspiration, which is “the deluge of <a href="http://zoom.us" class="bib" target="_blank"></a>Zoom meetings [he has] been in for the last few weeks,
                and
                seeing the <a class="concept border anthropological-machine">range of contexts</a> framing all the faculty members’ and students’ faces.” He also writes about
                how
                he had actually started WFH (the act, not the project) ten years ago to spend more time with his newborn
                child, with the added bonus of “[saving] a two-hour daily commute and thousands of dollars in rent per
                month.”
            </p>

            <p>The reproach of the group chat called out the “<a class="concept power">thousands of dollars,</a>” an unfathomable amount of money to
                have, spend, or save. The reproach of the group chat screenshotted posts from our very own RISD faculty
                members, displaying sunlit corners and expansive desks surrounded by shelves filled with recognizably
                expensive design objects. The reproach of the group chat visualized itself as grainy shots of our own
                depression nests—dirty dishes, mouse traps, water damage, chairs broken and nailed back together to WFH
                another day. I thought about <a class="concept anthropological-machine">Dal Hayes</a>, a man recently laid off from the Redondo Beach Bonaventure
                Hotel, who called and left a desperate message under the impression that I was the regional unemployment
                office. I thought about my partner, a <a class="concept utility anthropological-machine">service worker</a> in NYC, who sends me photos of themself making
                deliveries in their fluorescent vest and construction mask, against the backdrop of applause from Manhattan residents paying thousands of dollars to WFH. I thought about possible
                <a class="keyterm power desire">futures</a> and probable futures. I wondered what day of the week it was.</p>

            <p>I have often quoted <a class="bib" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay" target='_blank'>Alan Kay</a> in saying, <a class="bib" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay"
                    target='_blank'>“the best way to predict the future is to invent it.”</a> My design
                practice, especially in the past year, has centered around the generation of <a class="concept power desire myth">visions of possibility or
                futurity</a>. My projects took the form of <a class="keyterm utility">tools</a> and aggregates to extend the limits of <a class="keyterm power">imagination</a>, which
                is
                the prerequisite for invention. I wanted to give form to <a class="keyterm desire">desire</a>, a Graphic Design will-to-power.
            </p>

            <p>But looking at @wfh_wfm, created by the same mind that organized <a href="http://allpossiblefutures.net/"
                    class="bib" target="_blank">All Possible Futures</a>, populated by the same
                names featured in <a href="http://allpossiblefutures.net/" class="bib" target="_blank">All Possible
                    Futures</a>, I am realizing that the “all” in “<a class="concept myth power">all possible futures</a>” is a count made by a limited
                <a class="keyterm power desire">imagination</a>. An <a class="keyterm border">insular</a> group of well-known designers continue to speak only to each other
                of the conditions of WFH in a global <a class="keyterm virus">pandemic</a>, with a tone-deafness made possible by a collective
                <a class="keyterm power desire">imagination</a> built on standing desks, tasteful houseplants, and job security. They imagine possibilities
                afforded by their own positionality; the <a class="keyterm system">engine</a> of their insularity publishes and republishes their
                imaginaries into being. In turn, I, an MFA candidate in a prestigious program, <a class="concept virus">reference and replicate</a>
                their
                insularity.
            </p>

            <div class="diagram"><img src="images/CP_Classes.png" alt="CAPITALISM WILL NOT AND WAS NEVER GOING TO SAVE US"></div>

            <p>The reproach of the group chat arose from the recognition of <a class="keyterm border">difference</a>: that <a class="concept border anthropological-machine">our circumstances were not
                reflected</a> in the <a class="concept desire myth lexicon">vision of possibility</a> posited by @wfh_wfm. The reproach, I now recognize, came also
                from a
                kind of entitlement: “they are Zoom users, we too are Zoom users, so why do we not have access to the
                same?”
                If the <a class="keyterm power desire">imaginary</a> of @wfh_wfm could feel so wrong to me, a member of the same pandemic class, how does
                this
                imaginary scale to other classes? In a 1999 NPR interview with <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson" class="bib" target="_blank">William Gibson</a>,
                the author states, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson" class="bib"
                    target="_blank">“the
                    future has already arrived—it’s just not evenly distributed yet.”</a> Is a <a class="keyterm power">future</a> that will arrive
                only for some
                worth imagining at all?</p>

            <p>This question, however, suffers in that it only asks about imagined <a class="keyterm power">futures</a>. Every class in the above
                diagram
                has the ability to <a class="keyterm desire">desire</a>, to imagine futures of varying types and scopes. <a class="keyterm desire power">Imagination</a>—though
                prerequisite
                to invention—does not guarantee invention. And even then, the positive correlation between the ability
                to
                invent and <a class="concept power">access to resources</a> becomes more significant when one factors in the <a class="concept virus power">ability to implement
                that
                invention</a> on a large scale. <a class="keyterm myth">History</a> has proven that the <a class="keyterm power desire">future</a> does not come from mere imagination or
                flash-in-the-pan invention; the future comes from continued <a class="keyterm virus">replication</a>.</p>

            <p class="subhead"><b>2. Spec Work</b></p>

            <p>Sometime in the early 2000s, my uncle, an electrician from Rockford, Illinois, was invited to <i>The
                    Tonight
                    Show with Jay Leno</i> as part of a “home inventors” showcase. He unveiled the Ultra-Clip™, a nail
                clipper that catches clippings in a small compartment for later disposal. Nearly 20 years later, my
                family
                members are the only people I know who use the Ultra-Clip™, and my uncle is still an electrician in
                Rockford, Illinois. He ran through his savings creating prototypes, but without <a class="keyterm power">capital</a>, the Ultra-Clip™
                could never enter mass production. When we (myself and my family) lose our Ultra-Clips, as is inevitable
                with small objects, we will enter a <a class="keyterm myth desire">future</a> of inferior design, at least as it pertains to nail care.</p>

            <p>I purchased my first iPhone—with great reluctance—in 2011, to replace my perfectly functional Blackberry
                Curve. The iPhone messaging UI diverged from previous texting models by placing all messages on the same
                screen, like an AIM or MSN chat thread. Upon hitting <a class="concept virus power">critical market mass</a>, this design shift left me
                (and
                other non-iPhone customers) dealing with barrages of single-line texts sent by iPhone users acclimated
                to
                this new <a class="keyterm interaction">interface</a>, users who had no idea that I would have to open their “lol”s and “?”s separately,
                one at
                a time, then delete them to make room in my 200-text limit inbox. The iPhone, ensured of its
                <a class="keyterm virus">promulgation</a> by
                <a class="keyterm power">capital</a>, <a class="concept virus desire">implemented its version of the future</a> upon all of us. </p>

                    class="bib" target="_blank">Oryx and Crake</a> (2003) by Margaret
                Atwood for its <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/speculative-everything" class="bib"
                    target="_blank">“speculative work[...]based on real science; focused on
                    social, cultural,
                    ethical, and political implications.”</a> This emphasis on <a class="concept desire ">tempered speculation</a> is crucial to Dunne
                and Raby’s
                arguments for critical design’s ability to construct new pathways for the <a class="concept desire power">social imaginary</a>. In the
                preface,
                they write:</p>

            <blockquote>A believable series of events that led to the new situation is necessary, even if entirely
                fictional. This allows viewers to <a class="concept anthropological-machine interaction vulnerable">relate the scenario to their own world</a> and to use it as an <a class="concept utility">aid for
                critical reflection</a>.</blockquote>

            <p>The effectiveness of a <a class="keyterm desire power">speculative</a> scenario, presented to an audience, is therefore contingent upon this
                <a class="keyterm myth">believability</a>—the degree to which it aligns with a given person’s understanding of “their own world.”
                <a class="keyterm myth">Empiricism</a> in science asserts that all knowledge is derived from <a class="concept anthropological-machine">sense-experience</a>, from firsthand
                experience
                of observable phenomena that repeatedly yields the same results under testing. What does empiricism look
                like when applied to <a class="keyterm power">future</a> phenomena, with knowledge <a class="keyterm negation">deferred</a> across time? What are the “<a class="concept anthropological-machine history border">social,
                cultural,
                ethical, and political implications</a>” of empiricism applied from a <a class="concept power hidden negation">limited or subjective present</a>?
            </p>

            <p>I share much of <a href="http://dunneandraby.co.uk/" class="bib" target="_blank">Dunne and Raby’s</a>
                enthusiasm for the potential of speculation to open critical realms in the
                present. However, when the <a class="keyterm desire power">future</a> is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/speculative-everything"
                    class="bib" target="_blank">“but a medium to aid imaginative thought,”</a> the future sets the
                preconditions for its own invention from an <a class="concept hidden power">insufficient view of the present</a>. The danger herein lies in
                <a class="concept virus">replicating—if not aggravating—the blind spots of the present</a> in visions of possibility. The
                as-yet-untrue
                nature of the future, though it loosens us from reality’s grip, simultaneously frees us from contending
                with
                its consequences until <a class="concept virus anthropological-machine">they are rendered, by design, inconsequential</a>. The tempered speculation of
                critical
                design must work to operate first on the level of the premise. Can a future imagined from the <a class="keyterm power">material</a>
                present of <a href="http://apple.com" class="bib" target="_blank">Apple</a>, or @wfh_wfm, or <a href="http://risd.edu" class="bib" target="_blank">RISD MFA</a> offer a vision of possibility that speaks to anyone else’s
                world?
                Which is the world of the iPhone? Which is the world of @wfh_wfm? Which is mine?</p>

            <p class="subhead"><b>3. <a class="keyterm virus">Virus</a> Against <a class="keyterm virus">Virality</a></b></p>

            <p>I am writing in the time of a <a class="keyterm virus">virus</a>. COVID-19 has driven <a class="concept utility power">non-essential workers</a> indoors, separating
                knowledge
                work even further from the <a class="keyterm vulnerable">vulnerability</a> of the social body. I am WFH; therefore, I must be
                non-essential.
                As <a href="http://metahaven.net/" class="bib" target="_blank">Metahaven</a> says, <a
                    href="http://frontdeskapparatus.com/files/015.pdf" class="bib" target="_blank">“we are”</a>—I am—<a
                    href="http://frontdeskapparatus.com/files/015.pdf" class="bib" target="_blank">“not useful.”</a></p>

            <p>I don’t mean to misquote <a href="http://metahaven.net/" class="bib" target="_blank">Metahaven</a>.
                “<a class="keyterm utility">Usefulness</a>,” by their definition, has to do with use value, or value by
                virtue of an object’s function, in opposition to added (or <a class="keyterm desire power">speculative</a> value, which <a class="keyterm virus">circulates</a> in a
                cultural <a class="keyterm power">market</a> separate from an object’s <a class="keyterm utility computer">function</a>. Surface design operates in the latter realm. Surface
                design can <a class="concept virus power lexicon">create its own value</a> by virtue of its separation from <a class="concept power border anthropological-machine myth">material, physical, or territorial
                limitations</a>. The surface designer is a knowledge worker separated from the <a  class="keyterm vulnerable">vulnerability</a> of the social
                body.
                The surface designer speaks to other surface designers about WFH; the surface designer references
                surface
                designers in their thesis compendium. <a class="concept virus">Surface design self-replicates.</a></p>

            <p>Design that creates its own value is not a <a class="keyterm virus">virus</a>. Viruses do not self-replicate; they cannot <a class="keyterm power">survive</a>
                without
                a host. Viruses are the ultimate <a class="keyterm adversarial">parasite</a>. </p>

            <p><a class="keyterm virus power system">Virality</a> does not imply a virus. “Virality,” in its current use, is a contemporary term most often
                employed
                in marketing to describe the rapid spread of an image or piece of information, most commonly over the
                Internet. Where this definition differs from that of a virus is in its ontology. <a class="concept virus open-closed">The images and
                information
                of virality are self-contained</a>. They do not <a class="keyterm computer virus adversarial">hack</a> or commandeer any of the <a class="keyterm anthropological-machine system">machinery</a> of its channels.
                Virality co-exists with the platform and floats on its surface (design). Virality need not be <a class="keyterm utility">useful</a>;
                virality can be <a class="keyterm desire virus">willed</a> by <a class="keyterm power">capital</a> and connections. Virality is an iPhone supported by <a href="http://apple.com" class="bib" target="_blank">Apple’s</a> global
                marketing engine. Virality is the ability to self-replicate.</p>

            <p>I want to design as a <a class="keyterm virus">virus</a>. I want to design towards <a class="keyterm utility">usefulness</a>, towards <a class="concept power anthropological-machine">material consequence</a>, towards
                <a class="keyterm adversarial open-closed">infiltration</a> and <a class="keyterm vulnerable">dependence</a>. </p>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Gonz%C3%A1lez-Torres" class="bib" target="_blank">Felix
                    Gonzalez-Torres</a> also worked in the time of a <a class="keyterm virus">virus</a>. That virus was HIV/AIDS. Gonzalez-Torres’s
                <a class="concept virus">viral
                strategy</a> utilized the visual <a class="keyterm lexicon">lexicon</a> of the <a class="concept power">capitalist art market</a> to infect the institution with his
                pieces,
                carriers of his ideological critique. Spectators who engaged with his work <a class="concept interaction">came into contact with his
                virus</a>,
                becoming carriers of the infection themselves and spreading it in the body politic through continued
                discussion of the questions raised in his work.</p>

            <p>When I think about how design becomes radical, I usually end up thinking of designing for actions and
                movements that on their own are doing the legwork of actual material change. What design has to offer
                here
                is a viral envelope, a protein layer rendered in the visual <a class="keyterm lexicon">lexicon</a> of the capitalist, mass-audience
                sphere
                so as to <a class="concept adversarial utility virus">infiltrate and utilize</a> its extended networks of dissemination, taste creation, and social
                signaling. In other words, design as a <a class="keyterm virus adversarial">parasite</a>, feeding on the <a class="power border">infrastructure</a> of its host to perpetuate
                its
                content. The more hegemonic the host, the greater the virus’ proliferation.</p>

            <p>I have often described my work as “<a class="keyterm adversarial hidden">Trojan-horsing</a>.” I have had my work described by others as
                “hoodwinking,”
                “swindling,” <a class="keyterm computer adversarial hidden">hacking</a>,” and “Robin Hood-ing.” I am realizing now that these terms circle the vocabulary
                of a
                virus.
            </p>

            <p>The <a class="concept virus">structure of a virus</a> includes its genome and a surrounding protein shell, or capsid, which helps the
                virus latch onto a <a class="keyterm virus">cell</a>, <a class="computer adversarial">hack</a> into it, and <a class="adversarial power">commandeer</a> its molecular machinery for the
                purposes of the virus’ <a class="concept virus power">own perpetuation</a>. A virus’ <a class="keyterm power desire">future</a> is grounded in modifying the <a class="concept power border">existing structure</a>
                of
                its host. The power of a virus’ future imaginary is indivisible from the material conditions of its
                present.
            </p>

            <p>This past year, I have evaluated each of my projects against a question: <a class="concept open-closed system">is this an open or closed
                system?</a>
                <a class="keyterm interaction">Interactivity</a> is the test of a <a class="keyterm system">system</a>; I found myself unwilling to make work that did not <a class="keyterm desire">require</a> it.
                And
                despite telling myself that the question was value-neutral, that it served only to help me make more
                intentional choices, I suspected that I preferred an <a class="concept open-closed">open system</a>, a <a class="concept vulnerable">permeable one vulnerable to change</a>
                by
                <a class="keyterm anthropological-machine border">user input</a>. <a id="interaction">Interaction</a> is the prerequisite for <a class="keyterm virus">infection</a>. Perhaps the
                generosity I
                aspire to in opening my work has more to do with the <a class="keyterm desire">desire</a> for <a class="concept vulnerable">closeness and exchange</a>, the desire to
                <a class="concept negation virus adversarial">turn
                others into virus factories</a> themselves.</p>

            <h2>4. Benware</h2>

            <div class="diagram"><img class="infection" src="images/CP_Infection.png" alt="CAPITALISM WILL NOT AND WAS NEVER GOING TO SAVE US"></div>

            <p>In <a class="keyterm computer">computers</a>, the word “<a class="keyterm virus">virus</a>” is often misused as interchangeable with
                “malware.”
                “Malware” is a catch-all term for all malicious software, including keyloggers, ransomware, spyware,
                rootkits, and false Browser Helper Objects (BHOs). The uniting characteristic of the listed examples is
                that
                they are independent pieces of software, possibly installed through a Trojan Horse or similar means,
                possibly masked as a “<a class="keyterm power">legitimate</a>” program, but essentially running on their own with the goal of <a class="concept hidden">quietly
                extracting</a> <a class="concept power">information and resources</a> to an <a class="concept border">outside receiver</a>. A <a class="keyterm computer virus">computer virus</a>, by definition, modifies
                other
                programs. Its modus operandi is the <a class="concept negation interaction">changing of states</a>.</p>

            <p>A <a class="keyterm virus">virus</a> is not a <a class="keyterm hidden">spy</a>; it is a <a class="keyterm adversarial">saboteur</a>. </p>

            <p>Here I want to turn to the word “<a class="keyterm adversarial">malicious</a>.” If a piece of software is categorized as MALware, its
                functions
                are understood to have <a class="concept adversarial">the intention to harm</a>. Implicit in this understanding is that <a class="concept vulnerable">the harm is to the
                user</a>, the majority of whom are personal <a class="concept computer anthropological-machine">computers (humans)</a> using their personal <a class="concept computer anthropological-machine">computers (machines)</a>.
                Malice
                is <a class="keyterm binary">relational</a>, and therefore, flexible. Applying this flexibility to <a class="keyterm virus">viruses</a>, if malware <a class="keyterm negation">≠</a> virus, can
                virus
                <a class="keyterm negation">≠</a> malware? Can viruses instead be benignant—“BENware,” so to speak? More specifically, can a virus act
                as a
                redirecting agent to divert harm intended for the user to <a class="concept power">other entities</a>? Or, true to its form, can my
                virus
                do a little harm in service of calling attention to a larger danger? Can my virus turn the user not into
                a
                virus factory, but a manufacturer of antibodies against me and the <a class="keyterm power">power</a> structure I rode in on?</p>

            <a class="concept binary">
                <h2>5. Non-Binary Binary Code</h2>
            </a>

            <p>I began my coding education in earnest in September 2019. By November, the majority of my time spent
                making
                “graphic design” projects was devoted to the <a class="keyterm utility system">functionality</a> of a <a class="keyterm computer">computational</a> back end. A faculty member
                recently asked how I imagined the GD program could support me, as I seemed to be shifting more into the
                purview of a developer rather than a designer. She clarified in a later conversation that she wasn’t
                setting
                up a <a class="keyterm binary">dichotomy</a>; if it communicates, then it’s Graphic Design.</p>

            <p>Ask a layperson to explain a piece of conceptual art, and you might be met with resistance. Have them
                read
                the wall text beside it, and a framework opens up for evaluation. <a class="keyterm lexicon">Language</a> (written and spoken) holds
                <a class="keyterm power">hegemony</a> over analysis, interpretation, and communication. </p>

            <p>The term “<a class="keyterm lexicon">code</a>” is used as shorthand for <a class="keyterm computer">computer</a> <a class="keyterm lexicon">language</a>. Computer languages employ
                different <a class="concept lexicon system">syntaxes and vocabularies</a> (in English, which is a criticism for another day) in service of
                speaking to a computer. Computers require the utmost precision of language and therefore operate at the
                extremity of written communication, which—through <a class="concept myth power anthropological-machine">logistical, historical, and societal factors</a>—already
                claims precedence in articulation. However, the execution of these communiques by the <a class="keyterm computer">computer</a> does not
                usually result in <a class="keyterm lexicon">language</a>. It results instead in <a class="keyterm interaction">interfaces</a>, processes, images, and <a class="keyterm power">infrastructures</a>. It
                results in <a class="keyterm system">systems</a>. </p>

            <p><a class="keyterm system">Systems</a> speak, and there are <a class="concept power border anthropological-machine">no neutral systems</a>. Much has been written about the
                dangers
                of assuming the <a class="concept border anthropological-machine">objectivity of computing</a>, especially under a state of surveillance (see: <a
                    href="https://www.excavating.ai/" class="bib" target="_blank">Machine Learning biases</a>, for one).
                The clarities and hard-boundary <a class="keyterm border">classifiers</a>
                employed in building the <a class="keyterm system">system</a> are masked in its output, creating a <a class="keyterm power">power</a> discrepancy between the
                writer/programmer/implementer and the end user. <a href="http://facebook.com" class="bib"
                    target="_blank">Facebook</a> had millions of users before a (written)
                journalistic article sounded the alarm on its <a
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/technology/facebook-privacy-hearings.html" class="bib"
                    target="_blank">data collection practices</a>, its <a

                    class="bib" target="_blank">shadowbanning of vulnerable populations</a>, its
                hand in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/what-facebook-did/542502/"
                    class="bib" target="_blank">influencing elections</a>. Similarly, I am—we are—implicated in <a class="concept power system">myriad
                structures</a> that seem indivisible
                from 21st century American existence, all implemented <a class="concept hidden">without every being put into words</a>. <a class="keyterm virus computer">Malware</a> that
                declares itself as such gets removed. The <a class="keyterm system">system</a> speaks with vested interest in never being heard.</p>

            <p>Visual communication is the purview of Graphic Design; the crux of the field is speaking without words.
                In
                this respect, GD is perfectly suited for the <a class="keyterm lexicon">translation</a> of wordless <a class="keyterm system">systems</a>. Here is where I identify
                the
                potential for a <a class="concept binary">Non-Binary Binary Code</a>, where the inherently interpretive space of visual design can act
                as
                a clarifying reagant for the murky narratives of <a class="keyterm computer system">computational systems</a> without falling into the same
                <a class="concept border">declarative trap</a>. </p>

            <p>However, <a class="keyterm lexicon">translation</a> requires working knowledge of both languages in question. To return to the
                biological
                <a class="keyterm virus">virus</a>, in order for a virus to <a class="concept vulnerable open-closed">attach to a cell</a>, the surface of the virus and the surface of a cell must
                <a class="concept lexicon">share a genetic vocabulary</a>. As <a class="keyterm computer">computation</a> increasingly insinuates itself as the substratum of
                contemporary
                existence, as major tech companies <a class="concept power adversarial">commandeer capital, labor, communication, and play</a>, as technocrats
                <a class="keyterm virus">replicate</a> their <a class="concept anthropological-machine">non-neutral social positioning</a> into a new normality, any critical stance I could
                communicate
                must be rendered with a shared vocabulary. My design, if it is to become a virus, must speak the
                language of
                development, and if my programs are to clarify the <a class="concept system">mechanisms of computational systems</a>, it must speak
                the
                <a class="keyterm lexicon">language</a> of design.</p>

            <p>Surface design is not enough for <a class="concept virus">design-as-virus</a>. Surface design is a removable wrapper. Surface design
                <a class="concept vulnerable">does
                not penetrate</a>; surface design is itself a cell, replicating in a mitotic process that <a class="concept power">canonizes only its
                own
                DNA</a>. Surface design is an organism that gambles on its own strength to build its uncertain <a class="keyterm power">futurity</a>.
                Meanwhile, design-as-virus knows itself <a class="concept vulnerable">to be weak, to be dependent</a>. It identifies <a class="keyterm power">power</a> as <a class="concept virus">the ability
                to
                self-replicate</a> and nests its own futurity in power’s <a class="concept virus power system">proliferatory mechanisms</a>. It does this even as it
                <a class="keyterm adversarial negation">sabotages</a> with an urgency borne of <a class="keyterm desire">need</a>. It risks its own <a class="concept negation adversarial">discovery and destruction</a>;
                it
                expects it; it hopes for it. Signaling the presence of <a class="keyterm virus adversarial computer">malware</a> is the function of benware. Benware tips
                the
                scales of <a class="concept power virus">power-as-malware</a> into <a class="keyterm lexicon">legibility</a>—even though doing so might <a class="concept negation">obsolete itself</a>—in service of
                <a class="concept power desire open-closed">opening
                the social imaginary</a> to a <a class="keyterm power">future</a> where it, and the structures that house it, <a class="concept negation">no longer exist</a> or are
                radically changed.</p>

            <p class="lastp"><a class="keyterm open-closed">Open systems</a> are <a class="keyterm vulnerable">vulnerable</a>. Opening up a system is an act of <a class="concept power">ceding control</a>, control over

                gives
                the user the <a class="concept negation power">power to destroy</a>. I want to design as a <a class="keyterm virus">virus</a>. I want to design towards <a class="keyterm vulnerable">weakness</a>, towards
